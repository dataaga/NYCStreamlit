# NYC Taxi Trip Duration Prediction
This repository contains the code and resources for predicting the duration of taxi trips in New York City (NYC).
The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately estimate the duration of taxi trips based on various input features.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the NYC Taxi Trip Duration dataset,
which provides historical trip data for taxi rides in NYC. It includes features such as
pickup and drop-off coordinates, timestamps, and additional information about each trip.
The dataset is publicly available and can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nyc-taxi-trip-duration/data

## Project Structure
The main components of this repository are as follows:

- `dataset/`: This directory contains the dataset files
- `models/`: Trained models and model artifacts saved in this directory.
- `pages/`: Source code and utility scripts for displaying the exploratory data & prediction simulation.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python dependencies required to run the project.
